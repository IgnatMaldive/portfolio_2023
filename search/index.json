In the power station, a power inverter converts the 12 volts DC into 220 volts AC, thus allowing us to power any electrical device. At Pedal Power we do not have batteries nor do we carry any other source of energy other than the one provided by the public.\n","date":"2019-02-09T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ignatmaldive.github.io/portfolio/p/pedal-power/pedal_power_hub904feb6a5f87a4fa1aee92f4cbdc97e_83091_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://ignatmaldive.github.io/portfolio/p/pedal-power/","title":"Pedal Power"},{"content":"MiniATM is a compact and simple Bitcoin Cash ATM.
